## Project Background

The Voice CodeGen Hexa project is an AI-powered code generation application that combines:
- **Voice Interface**: Animated hexagon character with OpenAI Realtime API integration
- **Code Generation**: Sophisticated backend for generating flowcharts and code
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Marimo-based Python notebooks for code execution

### Original Vision
The project aimed to create a seamless experience where users could:
1. Generate flowcharts through voice commands
2. Convert flowcharts to executable Python code
3. Run and interact with the code in real-time notebooks

## Original Render Architecture

### Single Service Deployment
The original architecture was deployed as a single Python FastAPI service on Render:

```yaml
# pitext_codegen/render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: pitext-codegen
    env: python
    buildCommand: |
      cd pitext_codegen && pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: |
      cd pitext_codegen && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips='*' --log-level warning --access-log
    plan: free
```

### Limitations Identified
1. **Execution Environment**: Limited to browser-based Pyodide execution
2. **Performance**: Slow WebAssembly-based Python execution
3. **Package Support**: Restricted to packages available in Pyodide
4. **Memory Constraints**: Browser memory limitations
5. **State Management**: No persistent notebook state
6. **WebSocket Support**: Limited real-time communication capabilities

## Migration Drivers

### Primary Motivations
1. **Performance Requirements**: Need for native Python execution speed
2. **Package Ecosystem**: Access to full Python package ecosystem
3. **Scalability**: Better handling of concurrent users
4. **Real-time Features**: Enhanced WebSocket and real-time capabilities
5. **Cost Optimization**: More efficient resource utilization
6. **Developer Experience**: Better debugging and development tools

### Strategic Considerations
- **Cloudflare Ecosystem**: Leverage edge computing and global distribution
- **Microservices Architecture**: Better separation of concerns
- **Container Technology**: Isolated execution environments
- **Modern Deployment**: CI/CD integration and automated deployments

## New Cloudflare Architecture

### Microservices Design
The new architecture consists of three main services:

```

## Detailed Migration Process

### Phase 1: Architecture Planning
1. **Analysis of Current Limitations**
   - Identified Pyodide performance bottlenecks
   - Assessed package compatibility issues
   - Evaluated scalability constraints

2. **Technology Selection**
   - Chose Cloudflare Workers for edge computing
   - Selected Cloudflare Containers for Python execution
   - Decided on microservices architecture

3. **Service Decomposition**
   - Separated frontend from backend logic
   - Isolated Marimo execution in containers
   - Designed API communication patterns

### Phase 2: Frontend Migration
1. **React Application Setup**
   ```typescript
   // apps/frontend/src/App.tsx
   // Modern React with TypeScript and Vite
   ```

2. **Voice Integration**
   ```typescript
   // apps/frontend/src/components/HexaWorker.tsx
   // OpenAI Realtime API integration
   ```

3. **Marimo Embedding**
   ```typescript
   // apps/frontend/src/components/MarimoNotebook.tsx
   // iframe-based notebook display
   ```

### Phase 3: Backend Development
1. **API Service Creation**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/routes/marimo.ts
   // Marimo generation endpoints
   ```

2. **AI Integration**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/services/llmService.ts
   // OpenAI API integration for code generation
   ```

3. **Container Communication**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/services/marimoService.ts
   // Communication with Marimo containers
   ```

### Phase 4: Container Implementation
1. **Docker Configuration**
   ```dockerfile
   # twilight-cell-b373/Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.11-slim
   # Marimo server setup
   ```

2. **Dynamic Notebook Creation**
   ```python
   # twilight-cell-b373/src/start_marimo.py
   # Fresh notebook generation per session
   ```

3. **Cloudflare Container Integration**
   ```typescript
   # twilight-cell-b373/src/index.ts
   # Container orchestration and routing
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### AI-Powered Generation Pipeline
The system uses a sophisticated 2-stage approach:

1. **Plain Python Generation**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/services/llmService.ts
   export async function generatePlainFromFlow(
     prompt: string, 
     mermaid: string, 
     language: string, 
     apiKey: string
   ): Promise<string>
   ```

2. **Marimo Conversion**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/services/plainToMarimo.ts
   export function plainToMarimo(py: string): string
   ```

3. **Sanitization and Validation**
   ```typescript
   // apps/backend/src/services/sanitizeMarimo.ts
   export function sanitizeMarimo(code: string): string
   ```

### Container Orchestration
The Marimo container service provides:

1. **Dynamic Notebook Creation**
   ```python
   def create_new_notebook():
       # Generate unique notebook names using timestamps
       # Create starter template with helpful code examples
       # Place notebooks in the /app/notebooks directory
   ```

2. **Server Startup Management**
   ```python
   def start_marimo_server():
       # Start Marimo with specific notebook file
       # Use --headless mode for container deployment
       # Configure proper networking for Cloudflare Containers
   ```

3. **Session Management**
   - Each container restart creates a new notebook
   - Notebooks are timestamped for uniqueness
   - Users get a fresh workspace every time

### Frontend Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend through:

```typescript
// Generate Marimo notebook
const response = await fetch('/api/marimo/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ 
    diagram: mermaidText, 
    language: 'python', 
    prompt: userPrompt
  })
})
```
